1. What did we do?
  During Info Sceince we were told to instruct Dr. Reuben how to create a jelly sandwhich. 
  Dr. Reuben posed as an operator, essentially he could follow basic instructutions. 
  This forced us to create instructions with incredible detail. 
2. What did you learn?
  We learned basic computational thinking. There are four steps to Computational thinking: 
      1 decomposition 
      2 pattern recognition 
      3 abstraction 
      4 algorithm design
  To successfully create a jelly sandwhich, we had to use these four steps. 
3. What questions do you have?
    Will we be learning html?
