Questions: 
What are some ways in which Computer Science can help fight against COVID-19? 

In the article, Bowman and his fellow scientists have created a software that enables them to 
essentially borrow computer power from others. This is mainly through the power of computer science. 
Without computer science, they would not have been able to study COVID’s spike proteins, as the 
simulations take up so much computer power. Another way that Computer Science has helped the fight 
against COVID-19 is the ability/possibility to actually create the simulations. Not only is the software 
for sharing power important, but the very program that they are trying to fuel. 

In your opinion, should people enable access to the resources of their personal computers as tools 
for research? Are there any risks?

In my opinion, trusting anyone with my personal devices would cause me to be a little bit skeptical. 
Mainly because my computer probably knows me better than I know me. But on the other hand, so much of 
our personal data is already being sold/traded by large organisations like Google and Apple, so it shouldn’t 
really matter to me. In the end, I’d most likely give up my computer’s power to help fight the COVID-19  
Fight because I don’t really have any information to lose anymore. And I would be doing it for a good cause.
